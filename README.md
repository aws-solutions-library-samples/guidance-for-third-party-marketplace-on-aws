## Third-Party Marketplace solutions for Retailers

Retailers want to offer a wide range of products to their customers but can't necessarily take on the cost of holding the inventory. For many, creating an online marketplace for thrid-party sellers addresses this problem and creates and additional revenue stream through listing fees. Customers, in turn, find more products they want and tent to spend more, creatinga virtuous cycle that benefits the retailer, the third-party sellers, and the customers.
