## Third-Party Marketplace Solutions for Retailers

Retailers want to offer a wide range of products to their customers but can't necessarily take on the cost of holding the inventory. For many, creating an online marketplace for thrid-party sellers addresses this problem and creates and additional revenue stream through listing fees. Customers, in turn, find more products they want and tend to spend more, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits the retailer, the third-party sellers, and the customers.
